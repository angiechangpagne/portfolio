<p>Angie Chang |  Full Stack Web Developer | </p>
<p> I champion the influence of the Tech Industry pushing into our reality. </p>

<p>Through the LaGuardia TechHIRE-Open Code program I have acquired industrious problem solving skills and collaboration to become a versatile developer.</p>

<p>I became familiar with agile and scrum methodologies using MVC architecture to design RESTful applications and web services as well as responsive front end sites. </p>

<p>More importantly, this program has taught me to become self enterprising, to venture onto my own projects and structure my knowledge through research and integration. </p>

<p>I like to think with a big picture mindset, and in a sense coding is like a marathon: you constantly adapt to new climates and technologies, innovation and endurance is key. </p>
<p>I hope to someday venture into my own routes, but my ultimate goal is to introduce new concepts and make an impact on society. </p>

<p>My target industry is Virtual and Augmented reality with a primary focus on Media and Entertainment. </p>
<p>My next move is to venture into the Greater Los Angeles arena. </p>
